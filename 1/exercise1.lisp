;; 2 Interpreting Common Lisp
;;What is the purpose of the following function?
;;The purpose of the following function is to count nr of elements in the list.

;;How does it achieve its goal?
;;It achieves it's goal by running recursive calls as long as the current list in
;;the recursice thread is not empty. In the case where the if test returns false,
;;it will start counting on the way back.

;;The "rest" function only works with lists as parameter, so we know that
;;the parameter foo has to be list in order to run the function foo without
;;returning any errors. It does not have to be a list with number either.

;;Current strategy doesn't ignore non-alphabetic characters and treats them as
